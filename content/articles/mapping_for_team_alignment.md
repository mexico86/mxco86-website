## How Can Wardley Mapping Help Team Working? {#how-can-wardley-mapping-help-team-working}

In our work with technical groups we often need to discover where thoughts
and assumptions lie. It's helpful to align with others and come to a common
understanding of the landscape both technically and in other areas of the
work. This is particularly important at the start of new activities, which
are sometimes difficult to grasp.

We've always been interested in tools and techniques to help with technical
communication and, perhaps more importantly, give structure when approaching
organisational challenges. About three or four years ago, when looking into
ways of communicating technical strategy, we discovered Wardley Mapping.
After using mapping in a few different areas it's become a vital tool in our
daily work.


## Facilitating Technical Conversations {#facilitating-technical-conversations}

We find the process of mapping helps to facilitate conversations within a
group. What we're looking for here is to support the agreements and
disagreements that help to create alignment on a project. We find
the mapping activity useful as a scaffold around which important
conversations can happen, often in an indirect manner. The maps themselves
provide an anchor for the discussion without explicit focus on a particular
technical question.

Without mapping we may have posed a question or proposed a solution with the
intention of starting a conversation. This is easily misinterpreted as
suggesting a preferred approach which can have the effect of shutting down
the team's own ideas on how to proceed. The mapping process allows the
generation and refinement of ideas to be owned by the group.


## Gaining Multiple Perspectives {#gaining-multiple-perspectives}

As a team's approach to an activity is established, interaction and
engagement with the mapping process can help broaden everyone's perspective.
For example, the concept of evolution of components is sometimes new to
people. When components are considered in this way it may bring up new
questions and perhaps offer a different viewpoint altogether. When a map is
drawn on a whiteboard, and a component is in a particular evolutionary
phase, the team may highlight how this relates to a particular problem and
are able to discuss that in new terms. When information is in front of a
group in a visual format itâ€™s hard to miss. The mapping activity allows
everyone to work together and often the key components of the work arise as
emergent properties of this interaction.


## Highlighting the Shape of Work {#highlighting-the-shape-of-work}

For new teams, recognising the need to explore something further is key. A
team with the ability to say, "let's map this!" has a tool to shine a
light on different issues as they arise. The map also serves as an indicator
of the shape of work as understood. It can help a team identify where
there's a cluster of effort in the 'custom build' phase meaning effort to
produce novel work. Alternatively an abundance of 'product' and 'commodity'
components may highlight a heavy integration overhead. The map gives form to
these patterns and becomes part of the team's overall shared understanding.

## Clarity of Approach {#clarity-of-approach}

We see Wardley Mapping as a tool for generating clarity of approach. A set
of maps is not a magical artefact and a team must still determine how to
take action in each specific area. Where group alignment is being
established the process of mapping is an excellent tool to help people think
and work together. The resulting maps are invaluable for clarification,
understanding and communication and can be used by a team in both internal
and external contexts.


## Where to Start? {#where-to-start}

The best way to start learning this technique is by reading the [excellent
book](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) by [Simon Wardley](https://twitter.com/swardley). Once you're up to speed with the basics there is a
wealth of [other material](https://github.com/wardley-maps-community/awesome-wardley-maps) to explore.
