## How Can Wardley Mapping Help Team Working? {#how-can-wardley-mapping-help-team-working}

In our work with technical teams we often need to discover where thoughts
and assumptions lie and whether these are common within the group. When
working with others we sometimes need help to align and come to a common
understanding of the landscape, both technically and in other areas of the
work. This is particularly important at the start of new activities, which
are sometimes difficult to grasp.

I am always looking for tools and techniques that help with effective
technical communication. I find these tools even more interesting when they
also provide some structure when approaching organisational challenges.
About three or four years ago, when hunting around for new ways of
communicating technical strategy, I discovered Wardley Mapping. After some
investigation and experimentation with using mapping in different areas and
contexts it has grown into a vital element of our toolkit.


## What is Wardley Mapping? {#what-is-wardley-mapping}

At a high level, Wardley Mapping is a process of assessing the value chain
of an activity in terms of evolution. The maps themselves are visual
descriptions of components and interrelations and attempt to show the
evolutionary stage of each constituent part. Mapping is best done as a group
as the process of producing the map requires in depth consideration and
discussion of the subject to break down components sensibly and determine
positions in terms of maturity. There is often disagreement and discussion
around the detail that requires some work to resolve. The result of the
mapping activity looks something like this:

## Facilitating Technical Conversations {#facilitating-technical-conversations}

I find the process of mapping helps to facilitate conversations within a
group. What's sometimes needed is an activity to support the agreements and
disagreements that help to create alignment on a project. Mapping can be a
scaffold around which important conversations can happen, often in an
indirect manner. The maps themselves provide an anchor for the discussion
without explicit focus on a particular technical question.

Without mapping it's more likely that other conversation starters will be
used such as posing a technical question or proposing a straw-man solution.
These are easily misinterpreted as suggesting or pushing a preferred
approach, which can have the effect of shutting down a group's ideas on how
to proceed. The mapping process allows the team to own the generation and
refinement of strategies, plans and techniques.


## Gaining Multiple Perspectives {#gaining-multiple-perspectives}

As a team is establishing an approach, interaction and engagement with the
mapping process can help broaden everyone's perspective. For example, the
concept of evolution of components is sometimes new to people. Considering
components in this way may bring up new questions and perhaps offer a
different viewpoint altogether. As the group maps out a domain on a
whiteboard, and a component is in a particular evolutionary phase, the team
may highlight how this relates to a particular problem and are able to
discuss that in new terms. When information is in front of a group in a
visual format it can help clarify the finer points. The mapping activity
allows everyone to work together and often the key components of the work
arise as emergent properties of this interaction.


## Highlighting the Shape of Work {#highlighting-the-shape-of-work}

For new teams, recognising the need to explore something further is key. A
team with the ability to say, "let's map this!" has a tool to shine a
light on different issues as they arise. The map also serves as an indicator
of the shape of work as understood. It can help a team identify where
there's a cluster of effort in the 'custom build' phase meaning effort to
produce novel work. Alternatively an abundance of 'product' and 'commodity'
components may highlight a heavy integration overhead. The map gives form to
these patterns and becomes part of the team's overall shared understanding.

## Clarity of Approach {#clarity-of-approach}

I see Wardley Mapping as a tool for generating clarity of approach. A set
of maps is not a magical artefact and a team must still determine how to
take action in each specific area. Where members of a group are establishing
areas of alignment, the process of mapping can help people think and work
together. The resulting maps are invaluable for clarification, understanding
and communication and a team may use them in both internal and external
contexts.


## Where to Start? {#where-to-start}

The best way to start learning this technique is by reading the [book](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) by
[Simon Wardley](https://twitter.com/swardley). Once you're up to speed with the basics there is a wealth of
[other material](https://github.com/wardley-maps-community/awesome-wardley-maps) to explore.
