## How Can Wardley Mapping Help Team Working? {#how-can-wardley-mapping-help-team-working}

In our work with technical groups we often need a bit of help to discover
where our thoughts and assumptions lie. We also usually need to align with
others and come to a common understanding of where we are, both technically
and in other areas of the work. This is particularly apparent at the start
of new activities that we maybe don't understand so well.

We've always been interested in tools and techniques to help with technical
communication and, perhaps more importantly, aid in approaching
organisational challenges. About three or four years ago, when looking into
ways of communicating technical strategy, we discovered Wardley Mapping.
After using mapping in a few different areas it's become a vital tool in our
daily work.


## Facilitating Technical Conversations {#facilitating-technical-conversations}

We find the process of mapping helps to facilitate conversations within a
group. What we're looking for here is to enable the agreements and
disagreements people need in order to create alignment on a project. We find
the mapping activity useful as a structure around which important
conversations can happen, often in an indirect manner. The maps themselves
provide an anchor for the discussion without explicit focus on a particular
technical question.

Without mapping we may have posed a question or proposed a solution with the
intention of starting a conversation. This is easily misinterpreted as
suggesting a preferred approach which can have the effect of shutting down
the team's own ideas on how to proceed. What we want is for as many ideas to
come from the group as possible and for that process to be owned by the
team. We found that adding the process of mapping to a team's approach to
their work can facilitate this.


## Gaining Multiple Perspectives {#gaining-multiple-perspectives}

When a team's approach to an activity is being formed, interaction and
engagement with the mapping process can give everyone a new perspective. For
example, the concept of evolution of components is sometimes new to people
as a way of framing things. When components are considered in this way it
may bring up new questions and perhaps offer a different viewpoint
altogether. When a map is drawn on a whiteboard, and a component is in a
particular evolutionary phase, the team may highlight how this
relates to a particular problem and are able to discuss that in new terms.
When information is in front of a group in a visual format itâ€™s hard to
miss. The activity allows everyone to work together and often the key
components of the work arise as emergent properties of the group's
interactions.

## Highlighting the Shape of Work {#highlighting-the-shape-of-work}

In general, we reach for Wardley Mapping when there is an activity or
environment that is new to us. It is especially useful when we are
struggling to grasp an idea or where we're not quite sure how something is
going to work. For new teams, recognising the need to explore something
further is key. A team with the ability to say, "let's map this!" has a
process and a tool to shine some light on different issues as they arise.

The map as an artefact also serves as an indicator of the shape of work
as understood. It can help a team identify where there's a cluster of effort
in the 'custom build' phase meaning effort to produce novel work.
Alternatively an abundance of 'product' and 'commodity' components may
highlight a heavy integration overhead. The map gives form to these patterns
and becomes part of the team's overall shared understanding.


## Giving Clarity of Approach {#giving-clarity-of-approach}

We use Wardley Maps and the process of producing them as a tool for
generating clarity of approach. A set of maps is not a magical artefact and
it won't tell you what to do, however, as an ongoing activity it's an
excellent way of getting people to think together and communicate both with
each other and with people outside the group.
