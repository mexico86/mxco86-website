## Experience {#experience}


### Mexico86 - Principle Consultant / September 2016 - Present {#mexico86-principle-consultant-september-2016-present}


#### LVMH Digital - Creation of a New Software Development Function {#lvmh-digital-creation-of-a-new-software-development-function}

In this long term engagement with the French global fashion corporation
we put together a new in-house software development function to
support the global operations of the 70+ Maisons within the group. The
multiple cross-functional teams are strongly user-needs driven and put
together with a culture of technical ownership and full autonomy in
mind. The teams have had success in a number of areas including chatbot
development, Clienteling and operational business management tools and
have deployed software to support activities across the globe. Varied
systems include event-driven serverless AWS, container-based
cloud deployments and integrations between cloud-based software and
on-premise legacy retail systems.


#### Sheffield Hallam University - Research Group Communication {#sheffield-hallam-university-research-group-communication}

In this short project a research group was aided in the creation and
organisation of a communication hub including a blog, mailing list and
dynamic visualisation of group skills. The overriding need is for the
system to be simple and self-managed by non-technical group. A static
publishing system was built using Netlify as a hosting platform and
JAMStack technologies Hugo and NetlifyCMS with custom data integration
and visualisation using a serverless AWS backend and D3.js


#### The Developer Academy - Training Course Design and Delivery {#the-developer-academy-training-course-design-and-delivery}

Working in partnership with the The Developer Academy to design, develop
and deliver training courses for the next generation of developers.


### The Net-a-Porter Group / March 2002 - September 2016 {#the-net-a-porter-group-march-2002-september-2016}


#### Chief Technical Architect {#chief-technical-architect}

Led the growth and development of the technical e-commerce, retail
management and operations systems over a period of fifteen years. Led
the growth of the development and operations teams for an initial period
of six years before focusing on the software development teams and
global system architecture. This period saw the company growing from
tiny beginnings in a Chelsea art studio to a global phenomenon with
offices in three continents and customers across the world.

This long period of employment encompassed many technologies and
strategies including a move from proprietary UNIX to Linux, from
on-premise servers to public cloud, Perl and Java systems to JavaScript
via Node.js, multiple database technologies both proprietary and open
source and countless third-party vendors. Working in this environment
gave me an excellent appreciation of the constant change in the
technology landscape.

Many of the groups achievements and milestones were aided a by a very
supportive and open company culture which was explicitly fostered from
the early days and consciously tended over time.
