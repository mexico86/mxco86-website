## Draft {#draft}


### Introduction / Premise {#introduction-premise}

Recently I've been thinking about why we use certain approaches in
particular ways, which I think is an effort to retrofit a more formal
method to the loosely associated set of techniques we tend to use. I spent
this morning considering a set of Wardley Maps, which we use extensively
as a tool to help with the development of a shared context, produced as
part of a long-term engagement in the fashion industry.

We often use the mapping process and the resulting maps to come to a
shared understanding of how various activities of a group fit into an
overall narrative. We also use more specific maps to surface and discuss
the finer points of work in specific areas. This has evolved over time
into a multi-level approach to mapping, with generally a single high-level
organisation map and multiple more specific maps showing components,
composition and external context in more detail.


### Top-Level Map - Organisational Context and Business Need {#top-level-map-organisational-context-and-business-need}

For this set of maps the group we were working with initially had fairly
loosely defined objectives. We were mainly working on adding internal
technical capability where previously it was outsourced. This meant that
the actual anchoring needs for the maps needed some thought. What we found
was that producing a rough map gave us an artefact to use in these
discussions with the group. It also served a purpose in upward
communication of team activities to C-level executives. The act of showing
how our proposed activities tied in with strategic objectives sparked
conversation on the detail of those objectives around the organisation. It
also served as validation that activities were anchored to an business
need which was previously not always clear and as the conversations
continued the anchoring needs of the maps could be refined and agreed.

### Second-Level Maps - Technical Context(s) {#second-level-maps-technical-context--s}

We use more detailed maps as more of a technical tool. One style which we
find helpful is a 'zoom' into the technical components of specific area of
the higher-level map, usually an area which we have defined as a
particular sub-team responsibility. The exercise of mapping these detailed
areas is a way of discussing where sub-team focus and energy is directed
on value-creation work (i.e. work in the genesis and custom space) and
where this is unnecessary (i.e. there are readily available product and
commodity components). It also highlights where there is extensive
integration work to be done. Even commodity components require effort to
piece together.

In general we work with teams that expected to make their own technical
decisions around the systems they are building but this type of mapping
allows some constraints and guiding principles (possibly some carefully
chosen elements of [Wardley's Doctrine](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2016/05/wardleys-doctrine.html)) to be surfaced and discussed.

The example in figure 2 is that of a retail communication tool focused on
direct customer interactions (figure 1's 'Team 4'). The team spent time
assessing the market around what they were trying to achieve and looking
at the technical platforms that could help them. Mapping was used in both
of these activities to help with perspective and context. The map shows
the technical platform comprised of mainly commodity technology with some
product-stage components. What was clearly missing at the time were tools
to create and manage different customer interaction flows. As a result
this was where most of the development effort was directed.

This more technical chart can be related to the higher level
organisational map, however, the higher-level is not just a simple roll-up
of the lower-level components. In fact, most of the detail shows
product-stage and commodity components with a smaller number sitting in
custom build. However, the fact that large and important technical
elements sit in the custom build stage places the overall component in
that domain in the higher-level representation. This very much depends on
the size and complexity of the custom components. A simple and easy to
deal with custom item would not exert that level of force on the overall
activity.


### Second-Level Maps - External Context(s) {#second-level-maps-external-context--s}

The two previous maps do not show anything about the external environment
that the group is operating in. We find that a third map can be useful to
represent this, sometimes focusing on a specific component that we feel is
worth effort. Mapping the environment of these components helps us stay
aware of other developments in the space and how things are moving
relative to what we are doing. i.e. is our work still valuable and is the
effort still justified. It also helps us to spotlight organisational
inertia where that is a concern, rather than having these elements as
secondary items on a more complex map. Figure 3 shows a context map used
to highlight the constraints on the development of a component due to
factors within the wider organisation.

{{< figure src="/images/articles/2nd-level-context-wardley-map.png" caption="Figure 3: More Detailed Context Map" >}}

Highlighting the inertia as it relates to this particular team on the map
is useful only if we can then use this information in some way. In this
case the context map highlights an incorrect assumption in the previous
maps - the supporting data component is much more immature than first
thought. This presents a problem for the team and is not something that
they can explicitly control. Moving back up to the top-level context
allows us to see how we can deal with the problem on an organisational
level and there is a second team assigned to this area. The maps help us
address this as an explicit element of the organisational strategy. We
also highlight and detail the team's need and where it may benefit from
being a user of another team's work. Additionally we can now feed the new
information into the other maps to correct the position of the data
component.

### The Magic Number? {#the-magic-number}

The three maps shown are all related to the same small-ish team working in
the same larger organisation. They try and show different aspects of the
same activity. We found producing and using all the maps useful in
different ways and they helped us work through different problems and with
different conversations.

There is obviously a cost to producing and maintaining a number of
artefacts, especially when they are representing views and perspectives of
the same overall activity. The maps shown are representations of documents
that were more often than not scribbled on bits of paper. A low-overhead
method of mapping is key to allowing people to explore the processes and
represent different aspects on different charts, and also keep things in
motion as time passes. We do find that the ability to produce nice looking
charts does help with credibility when trust-building is needed. There
are some production techniques we use to help with the task of producing
the more polished maps but we'll save those for another post.


### What Can We Use In 'The Method'? {#what-can-we-use-in-the-method}

As this is the start of trying to sort-of-formalise our low-overhead
approach to development and technology what have we learned from this
mapping activity and the utility of this set of maps? Having thought about
it:

-   High-level maps can show a clear link between an activity and a
    high-level organisational need
-   Limiting the components on a particular map allows focus on a certain
    area and user need
-   Pulling out components for more focus allows for different views on a
    particular area (technical component makeup, external market etc.)
-   Maps can be related to each other i.e. a more detailed map can highlight
    the reason for the placing of a particular component on a higher level
    map
-   The process of producing multiple maps helps to spark discussion around
    the anchoring points and assumptions that may not hold under scrutiny
-   The more maps you have the more your mapping overhead. It helps to keep
    things simple and fairly transient, especially for the more detailed
    representations that become outdated very quickly


### Further Reading {#further-reading}

-   The [Wardley Maps](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) book contains discussion and examples of each of these
    types of map
-   For some more in-depth discussion of representing sub-system components
    within maps see [this excellent article](https://latticecut.github.io/wardleymaps/2020/01/05/structural-deepening.html) which discusses the evolution of
    components in a jet engine
