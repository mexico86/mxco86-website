There is an axiom of creative writing which states 'Show, don't
tell'. This is a fairly trite statement which doesn't even take it's own
advice, but you'll have to put up with me talking about it as it serves
my point. Following 'Show, don't tell' the specifics of a scene are
described in rich detail giving enough information to the reader to
understand the flow of action. Intentions and emotions are not
explicitly stated giving the reader the opportunity to bring their
own interpretations and be fully involved in the story. Why is this
important? Because telling someone how to act, think or feel results in a
dry, lifeless and fairly irritating experience. Showing action, activity
and detail in motion brings a situation to life, makes it tangible and
gives depth.

## Just what is it that we want to do?

One of the Digital Atelier's prime directives is to protect the innocent bring
software as a skill to LVMH, helping maisons to develop and use bespoke
technology to support their retail activities. In essence this is education
around all the activities involved in defining a problem, identifying where a
software solution could help and building, operating and curating that
software in the simplest way possible. Part of this involves working with a
maison's existing teams and infrastructure to integrate software and process
into the organisation. To ensure the success of this approach DA engage in a
partnership for a period of time with a maison whilst the internal teams learn
the software development skills required to operate the systems without our
help. Our engagement is always grounded in a specific activity with a primary
focus on understanding and helping a group of users and therefore the skills
transfer and education activities may be a long term goal.

## How are we communicating?

What this comes down to is that software is built and run by people and what
those people do as an ongoing activity is what we want to communicate to the
maisons. How have we done this so far? Off the top of my head here's a few
examples:

-------------

### Digital Atelier
* Shown how to bring together fully capable teams focused on addressing
  pain points for a defined set of users

### Seamless
* Shown how a user-focused investigation process can result in an MVP
  definition that has tangible benefits for users
* Shown how to build and release software on a short, iterative cycle
* Shown how important good base data is to the success of a software
  product
* Shown how to gather user feedback on an ongoing basis and use this
  information to plan the next stages of development

### Conversation
* Shown how an idea can be prototyped, iterated on and released quickly
  for a specific purpose

### API+Toolkit
* Shown how a process to correctly manage and expose data is required to
  run applications on that data

------------

We've only scratched the surface of this and as we build closer ties to
the maisons we're working with we will hopefully have the opportunity to
show more of what we do, for example:

* How we do continuous integration and delivery
* How we manage cloud infrastructure and operations
* Our security practices and data protection and how these feed into a
  team's activities
* Our system design and architecture activities and how these iterative,
  ongoing part of a product team's work
* etc.

## So why bother?

Exposing our practices to our maison partners sounds like a load of extra work
and they might not agree with our practices anyway, so why should we bother?
By doing all of this we backup our opinions and experience with actions that
can be observed and tangible products that deliver value to the business.  We
show activity that solves problems for users and products that behave in
interestingly unexpected ways under real conditions and need shepherding
towards constant improvement. The details of both the activity and artefacts
we produce can be investigated and critiqued. We are not consultants telling
maisons what to do. Anyone can wag their finger when they see practice that
they know will cause problems immediately or in the future. Showing how
improvements can be made by building and running examples of those
improvements over time is difficult, however, it is an excellent way of
communicating that technology is something a business does rather than
something it owns.
